Red Huffman Tree

(Color, Frequency, Huffman Representation, Total Bits)

( 0, 19701, 1, 1 * 19701 )
( 255, 20299, 0, 1 * 20299 )

With total of 5000 bytes

Green Huffman Tree

(Color, Frequency, Huffman Representation, Total Bits)

( 0, 30199, 0, 1 * 30199 )
( 255, 9801, 1, 1 * 9801 )

With total of 5000 bytes

Blue Huffman Tree

(Color, Frequency, Huffman Representation, Total Bits)

( 0, 30100, 0, 1 * 30100 )
( 255, 9900, 1, 1 * 9900 )

With total of 5000 bytes

Total memory after compression is 5000 + 5000 + 5000 = 15000 bytes
Compression ratio is 12.5%
